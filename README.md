A bunch of convolutional neural networks implemented in Python 3, PyTorch.

Designed for viewing in GitHub.

The following models are included:

- AlexNet
- VGG
- ConvNeXt
- ResNet 18 and 50
- DenseNet
- SqueezeNet
- MobileNetV3
- EfficientNet
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
- GoogleNet (Inception v1)
- ResNeXt
- Wide ResNet
- InceptionV3

I used the CIFAR-100 dataset for training and testing all models, so some numbers are different then that of the actual papers.
